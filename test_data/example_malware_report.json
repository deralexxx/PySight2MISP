          "analysis": "<p>Some variants contain dynamically generated code to evade signature-based detection by anti-virus, and the malware installs as a system driver to perform hooking of system commands for stealth and persistence. The malware is updated via HTTP from domains stored in a local configuration file and uses peer-to-peer communications for command and control. This allows for Sality to be highly resilient to sinkholing. To add to its resilience, the malware frequently checks for updates, which are signed by the author's RSA key. This integrity check precludes the possibility of poisoning the bot network using dummy configuration files. The malware steals credentials by capturing a user's keystrokes, and it acts as a generic platform for installing additional payloads under the pay-per-install model. Sality's rootkit functionality prevents detection by host-based security tools and blocks connections to anti-virus and malware removal sites.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sality attempts to connect to one of a hard-coded list of domains to get an updated list of commands and peers.<em>{deleted some content for example brevity}</em> valign=\"bottom\" nowrap=\"nowrap\">\n<p>&#160;</p>\n</td>\n<td width=\"138\" valign=\"bottom\">\n<p>&#160;</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</table>",

The malware has features to persist on victim systems, evade anti-virus software and spread to additional machines. The malware's primary function is to act as a flexible and resilient platform for other actors in the underground economy to install malware on Sality-infected machines, including credential theft malware, fake anti-virus, spam tools and ransomware.",
